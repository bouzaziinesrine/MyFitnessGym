            <h1>Cardio Training Information</h1>
            <p>Cardiovascular training, commonly referred to as cardio, is a type of exercise that focuses on increasing your heart rate and breathing rate to improve overall cardiovascular health. It involves activities that raise your heart rate and keep it elevated for an extended period, such as running, cycling, swimming, and jumping rope.</p>
            <p>Cardio training is beneficial for improving heart health, lung capacity, and endurance. It can also aid in weight loss by burning calories and improving metabolism. Additionally, regular cardio exercise has been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>
            <p>When engaging in cardio training, it's important to choose activities that you enjoy and can sustain over time. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercise per week, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week.</p>
            <p>There are many different styles of yoga, each with its own emphasis and techniques. Some popular styles include Hatha yoga, Vinyasa yoga, Ashtanga yoga, Bikram yoga, and Kundalini yoga.</p>
